# PWA for the Global Leadership Conference

This is the code repository for the Global Leadership Conference of the International Christian Churches, a.k.a. Soldout Discipling Movement. The content of this app is 100 percent static.  Any dynamic functionality will come from fetch calls to external APIs on other servers.  The entire app is meant to be hosted on any platform for a static site (e.g. Apache, Nginx, Node/Express public folder, etc.).

This app is also intended to be a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA), which uses browser technologies like service workers, fetch request interception, caching and installation (i.e. adding a bookmark with a launch icon to the home screen of a user's mobile device).  This will be facilitated by [Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/), launch icons, a manifest.json file and pertinent HTML, CSS and javascript markup.
